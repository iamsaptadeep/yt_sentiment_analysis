@Jerbear112266,"Gold is not a hedge or an investment it is money silver is money. Everything else is debt slavery! Gold and Silver are not going up in value or price. Itâ€™s the dollar that is collapsing and crashing. Inflation is infinite paper digital fiat currency chasing the same finite limited commodities. Gold is the Canary in the coal mine for every collapsing currency throughout history. Only gold silver and copper is money. Everything else is debt slavery! 15 years of 0% interest rates and $25 trillion of fake liquidity dumped into all markets inflating bubbles everywhere. We are in the everything bubble Real Estate is going to crash. Stock market crash more severe than 1929. The bond market is going to crash and the big one is the US dollar is going to crash it's already been crashing. When all the debts collapses all the currency disappears. * A gold 400 ounce bankers bar used to be $8000 today it's 1.5 million. The same thousand ounces of gold buys you the same house in every decade. Paper electronic currency is not money for money to be money. It must be a commodity. Do you think you lost any purchasing power? 37 trillion in bond debt 200 trillion in unfunded liabilities. And the top 10 US banks have 3700 trillion in derivatives. That's 3.7 quadrillion toxic assets. Quote from the Oracle of Omaha Warren Buffett derivatives are the weapons of mass financial destruction!! Bank holiday coming bank runs too, banks are bankrupt and completely insolvent! 2008 bank liquidation still in progress! Not to mention 20 trillion of commercial real estate going into default! 7 trillion of US debt thatâ€™s coming up for renewal at higher interest rates, this year! 1.9 more Trillion in deficits this year. Debt ceiling also coming up. Government shut down, monetizing debts debasing the currency and diluting it. We are at the very end of the Keynesian debt based economy experiment. Drumpf is just a puppet to the Federal Reserve Board, military industrial complex, Freemasonry the Monarchy. Above all the Draco Reptilian Empire! Gold is the Canary in the coal mine for every collapsing currency throughout history. Cryptocurrencies will only exacerbate inflation of Fiat currencies!",61,2025-10-17 11:03:47+00:00

@Jerbear112266,"@crwelch12 It may very well be a hedge only because itâ€™s real money for money to be money, it must be a commodity amongst goldâ€™s other attributesâ€¦ currencies like crypto are not money.

@RussAlan-x2j,"Itâ€™s always advisable to invest judiciously, keep a stop loss figure. Shuffle between debt and equity wherever the ratio goes too off your target. As for the target, I recommend a Ratio like this Debt % should be equal to your age in years. If you are 20, debt is 20%, reset in equity. If the market falls or rises drastically, your debt % will change, which you should rebalance to 20% and bring back equity to 80%. Thus you would have bought low or booked profit depending on if it was a crash or a bull run, you still have the chance to improve you financial level by following Mills Wiesenerâ€™s program.",0,2025-10-17 14:13:02+00:00
