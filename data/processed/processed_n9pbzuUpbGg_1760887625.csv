UgwxmrUXVRHzMpoQ6-B4AaABAg,@ramkumarrealm,"Gold price surge: Gold‚Äôs price shot past $4,000 per ounce in October 2025, driven by eroding confidence in the US dollar, increased geopolitical tensions, and economic uncertainty, including the impact of Trump's trade war and doubts about the Federal Reserve‚Äôs independence.

Flight to gold: Traditionally, crises led investors to buy US dollars and treasuries, but now gold has become the preferred safe-haven asset. Central banks and investors are rapidly buying gold.

Debasement trade: The sharp rise in gold, parallel to the US dollar‚Äôs decline, reflects a loss of faith in government-backed bonds and currencies. Gold‚Äôs independence from government influence and its lack of counterparty risk makes it especially appealing in uncertain times.

Federal Reserve and inflation: Pressure from the White House on the Fed, lower interest rates, and inflation further increase gold‚Äôs appeal compared to cash and bonds.

Geopolitical context: After Russia‚Äôs 2022 invasion of Ukraine and subsequent Western asset freezes, countries started diversifying away from the dollar to protect against future US sanctions‚Äîleading central banks to heavily increase gold reserves. China has emerged as the biggest gold consumer and buyer, aiming to reduce reliance on the dollar.

Declining dollar dominance: The dollar‚Äôs share of global reserves has slipped since 2000. Trade conflicts, sanctions, and inflation have prompted trading partners to reconsider dollar-based trade.

ETF demand and alternatives: Gold-backed ETFs provide easy access for investors. September 2025 saw huge ETF inflows, and silver and platinum prices have also rallied. Cryptocurrencies like bitcoin are viewed as alternative haven assets by some.

Future outlook and volatility: Gold‚Äôs rally reflects the fragile geopolitical climate, weakening old alliances and forming new ones.

I guess we trade hard, rare, bearer assets for imaginary paper assets, in order to more easily spend them -- fiat currency (currently) is more liquid, divisible, and fungible.

For the world to finally correct itself, heal itself, and move backwards towards a more fair society, we ideally need to go back to a currency pegged by a hard, rare, bearer asset that can be held in custody by nation states and corporations as a means of final settlement -- be it gold, bitcoin, or a weighted blend of both. Moving away from the gold standard, towards fiat currency is the worst thing that ever happened. It has lead to the enshittification of everything, shrinkflation, skimpflation, decades of theft of the working class' productivity, and increased inequality. It only really benefit those closest to the banks that do the printing, as they are first in line to swap their made up money for hard assets like gold, wine, real estate, stocks etc. etc.
